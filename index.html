                This is a project for the course "Web Programming" at the
                University of Macedonia. The project is about a website that
                provides information about the weather in different cities
                around the world. The user can search for a city and get
                information about the weather in that city. The user can also
                create an account and save cities to his profile. The user can
                also delete cities from his profile.
